description: Run four convention checks (semgrep, secrets scan, manifest drift, Mermaid lint) and report violations. A useful pass before a PR, not a mirror of your CI; it says at the end what it did not run. Safe to run at any time, read-only unless the user asks to fix violations.
argument-hint: "[--only semgrep|secrets|manifest|mermaid]"

**Before doing anything else:** Check whether `.hitl/` exists in the current directory. If it does not, stop immediately and output this — do not proceed with any steps:

```
This project hasn't been set up for HITL.
To get started, run one of these commands in your project directory:

  /hitl:dev-start-from-prd      new project from a PRD
  /hitl:dev-start-brownfield    adopt HITL on an existing codebase
  /hitl:dev-start-migration     migrate a system
```

# Check Conventions

Run convention checks against the current codebase and report violations in-chat. Uses semgrep for code rules and standalone scripts for secrets detection, manifest drift, and Mermaid checks.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (optional — `--only semgrep|secrets|manifest|mermaid` to run a subset)

---

## Required tools

This skill shells out to external CLIs. If a check's tool is not installed, report the install command for it rather than failing silently — the secrets check has a built-in `grep` fallback.

- **Semgrep check:** `semgrep` (`pip install semgrep` or `brew install semgrep`)
- **Secrets scan (one of):** `gitleaks`, `trufflehog`, `detect-secrets`, or `semgrep`; falls back to `grep` if none is installed
- **Manifest drift + Mermaid checks:** `python` / `python3` (runs the bundled `ci/` and `scripts/` checkers)

---

## Step 1 — Run the checks

Run all four checks (or a subset if `--only` is specified):

### Semgrep (code conventions)

```bash
semgrep scan --config .semgrep/ --error
```

If semgrep is not installed, say: "Install semgrep: `pip install semgrep` or `brew install semgrep`"

### Secrets scan (blocking)

Detect hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, and connection strings committed to the repository.

Preferred tool — run whichever is installed:

```bash
# gitleaks (fastest, git-aware)
gitleaks detect --source . --no-git --redact

# trufflehog (deep entropy scan)
trufflehog filesystem . --only-verified --fail

# detect-secrets (baseline-aware)
detect-secrets scan --all-files | detect-secrets audit

# semgrep secret rules (if neither above is installed)
semgrep scan --config "p/secrets" --error
```

If none of these tools is installed:
```bash
# Fallback: grep for common patterns
grep -rn --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.env" \
  -E '(password|secret|api_key|apikey|access_key|private_key)\s*[:=]\s*["\x27][^"\x27]{8,}' \
  --exclude-dir=".git" --exclude-dir="node_modules" --exclude-dir="__pycache__" .
```

Flag any match as a **blocking violation** — a secret committed to the repo cannot be un-committed without a full history rewrite and credential rotation.

**What counts as a secret violation:**
- Hardcoded passwords, tokens, or API keys (non-placeholder values)
- Connection strings containing credentials (`postgresql://user:pass@host/db`)
- Private keys or certificates embedded in source files
- `.env` files committed with real values (not `.env.example` / placeholder files)

**What does NOT count:**
- Placeholder values (`"your-api-key-here"`, `"CHANGEME"`, `"<INSERT_SECRET>"`)
- Test fixtures using obviously fake credentials (`"test-password-123"`)
- References to vault paths (`"vault/secret/db_password"`, `"${DB_PASSWORD}"`)

### Manifest drift

The checker derives its scan roots from the manifest's listed files, so no `--source-dirs` is needed. If the script is absent (it is copied into the repo during onboarding), report that it is not installed rather than treating the check as passed:

```bash
if [[ -f ci/manifest-drift/check_manifest_drift.py ]]; then
  # The same flags the shipped CI workflow uses (ci/workflows/convention-check.yml). Without
  # --strict an unlisted file is a warning and the exit is 0, so this ran green locally and the
  # identical checker failed in CI on the identical file (#113).
  python ci/manifest-drift/check_manifest_drift.py --require-manifest --strict
else
  echo "SKIPPED: ci/manifest-drift/check_manifest_drift.py not installed: run /hitl:dev-start-brownfield Step 3, or copy it from the plugin's shared/ci/manifest-drift/. Manifest drift was NOT checked."
fi
```

### Mermaid br tags

```bash
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec python scripts/fix_mermaid_br_tags.py --check {} +
```

---

## Step 2 — Report results

Present the results grouped by status:

**Violations (must fix before merging):**
- List each violation with file path, rule ID, and what's wrong
- For each, suggest the fix
- Secrets violations: always list the file and line; never print the actual secret value

**Warnings (should fix, not blocking):**
- List warnings

**Passing:**
- Summary count: "N checks passed"

Then close with the boundary, every time, so a green result is never read as "CI will pass":

> This ran four checks: semgrep, secrets, manifest drift, Mermaid. It did not run this project's CI. Gates that live only there (formatters, type checks, migrations, dependency audits, anything under `.github/workflows/`) were not checked.

---

## Step 3 — Offer to fix

For each violation, ask:

"Want me to fix [violation]? I'll generate the fix and you can review."

If the user says yes, generate the fix following the project's conventions from `CLAUDE.md` and the system manifest.

For secrets violations: the fix is always to remove the hardcoded value, replace it with an environment variable reference or vault path, and rotate the leaked credential.

For Mermaid violations, offer to run the fixer: `python scripts/fix_mermaid_br_tags.py <files>`

---

## Important Rules

- Run from the project root
- Semgrep rules are in `.semgrep/` organized by category (security, correctness, best-practices)
- To add a new convention, create a semgrep rule YAML in the appropriate `.semgrep/` subdirectory
- If the manifest is missing or stale (drift detected), flag it: "The manifest may be out of date. Run the manifest generator to refresh it."
- Secrets violations are always blocking — there is no "warn and proceed" path for a committed secret

## Closing this step

When this step is done, close it the way `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/next-step.md` describes: what finished, what is
next in words that say what it achieves, and how to start it. Read the next step and its `command`
from `.hitl/current-change.yaml`; `manual` and `guided` are not commands and must not be rendered as
one. Do not list the remaining steps, restate what just happened, or ask permission to continue.
