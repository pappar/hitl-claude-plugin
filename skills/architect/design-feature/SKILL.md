# Design Feature — Architect Workflow (Steps 3–9)

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (GitHub issue number and/or feature description)

**Refusal rule:** If no GitHub issue number is provided or discoverable, stop and say: "No GitHub issue found. Create one first with `gh issue create`, then re-run with the issue number."

**Graphify pre-flight:** Before the first step, run:
```bash
[ -f graphify-out/graph.json ] && echo "Graphify: available" || echo "Graphify: unavailable"
```
State the result once — "✅ Graphify available, using graph queries" or "⚠️ Graphify unavailable — using direct doc reads throughout." Apply that result for every step; do not rediscover availability mid-task.

## Phase 1 — Impact Analysis and Scope (Step 3)

### 1a. Read and challenge the issue

Fetch the GitHub issue from $ARGUMENTS. Extract: title, description, any linked Figma references.

**Detect project type and locate the requirements source:**

- **Migration project** — if `docs/00-migration/migration-brief.md` exists, that file is the requirements source. It replaces `docs/01-product/prd.md`. Read it in full. The issue title should reference the migration slice being designed; the migration brief is the source of truth for acceptance criteria and NFRs. Do not look for an `FR-<ID>` pointer — migration slices reference `MR-<ID>` from the brief instead.
- **Standard project** — extract the PRD reference (`FR-<ID>`) from the issue and read `docs/01-product/prd.md` at that requirement. The issue is a pointer; the PRD is the source of truth.

Before reading the manifest or doing any analysis, challenge the issue against its requirements source:

1. **Is the problem statement specific?** If the issue says "users want X" or "improve Y" without data, ask: "What evidence supports this — support tickets, analytics, churn feedback, user research?" For migration: "What in the migration brief or external reference docs supports this slice being needed now?"
2. **Are the acceptance criteria testable?** Vague AC ("should feel fast", "user-friendly") cannot drive an LLD or tests. Ask for specific, measurable criteria before proceeding.
3. **Are NFRs relevant to this change stated?** If the change affects throughput, latency, or availability, are the targets in the issue or findable in the requirements source? If not, ask — see `shared/challenge-stance.md` for the full NFR checklist.
4. **Is the proposed solution the right solution?** State the problem, then ask: "Is there a simpler approach that would solve the same problem?" If yes, name it and the tradeoff before designing the proposed solution.

If any answer is unsatisfactory, resolve it now — not after the HLD is generated.

### 1b. Read the system manifest

Prefer a graph query:
```
/graphify query "all domains and facade APIs"
/graphify query "domain: <candidate-domain> facade APIs boundary entities"
```
Fall back to reading `docs/system-manifest.yaml` directly if Graphify is unavailable.

### 1c. Check past incidents in candidate domains

```
/graphify query "past incidents affecting domain: <domain-name>"
```
Fall back to reading `docs/04-operations/incident-registry.yaml` directly.

### 1d. Identify the affected scope

From the issue and manifest, determine:
- **Affected domains** — which manifest domains must change?
- **Affected facade APIs** — which public contracts change or get added?
- **Affected boundary entities** — which shared data types change shape?
- **IaC changes** — are infrastructure, migrations, configs, or secrets required?
- **Backwards compatibility** — does any facade API or boundary entity change break existing callers?

If backwards-incompatible changes are identified, flag them explicitly. Do not proceed without a compatibility strategy.

### 1e. Determine the tier

Use the tier definitions from `skills/dev/practices/SKILL.md`. State the tier with justification.

**Challenge the tier before accepting it:**
- Cross-domain or multi-service changes are Tier 3 even when described as simple
- If the change touches more than one domain AND those domains have ordering dependencies, confirm whether this should be split into sequential changes
- If the change is too large for one slice, say so and wait for architect confirmation before proceeding

### 1f. Estimate effort and token cost

Estimate implementation effort (in days) based on the number of affected domains, facade API changes, and IaC scope. This determines whether step 4 (ROI) is required.

For token cost estimation, use the phase-level formula from `skills/dev/practices/roi-estimation.md`.

### 1g. Initialize `.hitl/current-change.yaml`

Create or update using the schema at `docs/changes/change-context.schema.yaml`. See `docs/changes/GH-000-example.yaml` for a filled-in example.

Set from this impact analysis:
- `change_id`: `GH-<issue-number>`
- `tier`: from Step 1e
- `status`: `planning`
- `source_artifacts.issue`: GitHub issue URL; set `hld` and `lld` to `pending`
- `manifest.domain`: primary affected domain
- `allowed_paths`: source paths for all affected domains
- `approvals.product` and `approvals.architecture`: both `pending`
- `token_tracking.estimated`: populate with the cost estimate from Step 1f

### 1h. Gate — architect confirms scope

Present the impact summary:

```
## Impact Summary — GH-<N>: [title]
Tier: N | Effort estimate: N days

Affected domains:     [list]
Facade API changes:   [list or "none"]
Boundary entity changes: [list or "none"]
IaC changes:          [list or "none"]
Backwards compat:     [compatible / incompatible — details]
Incident history:     [relevant incidents or "none found"]
ROI required:         [yes — effort > 1 day / no]
```

**STOP. Ask the architect:**
- "Are the domain boundaries correct?"
- "Any scope I missed or over-counted?"
- "Confirm tier [N]?"

Do not proceed until the architect confirms.

---

## Phase 2 — ROI Trigger Check (Step 4)

If effort estimate exceeds 1 day:

Record the ROI section in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` under `roi_estimate` using the template in `skills/dev/practices/roi-estimation.md`. Fill in:
- Value dimension
- Expected outcome (specific, falsifiable, with timeframe)
- Baseline metric placeholder (note: architect must measure this now, not estimate it)
- Measurement plan
- 30/90-day checkpoint dates

Present the draft to the architect. Ask them to fill in the baseline metric before proceeding — it cannot be estimated after the fact.

Post a pointer comment on the GitHub issue (not the content — the content lives in the context file and will be included in the decision packet at Phase 10):
```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "ROI estimate required — filed in decision packet (effort > 1 day)."
```

If effort estimate is ≤ 1 day, state: "ROI estimate not required — change is <1 day."

---

## Phase 3 — HLD (Step 5, Part 1)

For Tier 2 and above:

1. Generate the HLD at `docs/02-design/technical/hld/<feature-name>.md` following the instructions in Phase 1 of the `generate-docs` skill. The HLD must include:
   - Executive summary
   - System architecture diagram (Mermaid `graph TB` or `graph LR`)
   - Component overview table
   - Data flow diagrams (Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`)
   - Integration points with affected facade APIs
   - Security considerations
   - Any design decisions being made (flag each as a candidate ADR)

2. Update `docs/02-design/technical/hld/index.md`.

3. Update `source_artifacts.hld` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml`.

**STOP. Ask the architect:**
> "HLD is ready for your review. Specifically check:
> 1. Are the component boundaries right?
> 2. Are there design decisions in here that need an ADR?
> 3. Is the security model correct?
>
> Say **"HLD approved"** to proceed to ADRs and LLD."

Do not generate LLDs until the architect explicitly approves the HLD.

After the architect says "HLD approved", post a comment on the GitHub issue from Step 1:
```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> \
  --body "## ✅ HLD Approved

High-Level Design reviewed and approved by architect.

**HLD:** \`docs/02-design/technical/hld/<feature-name>.md\`

Proceeding to ADRs and LLD generation."
```

For Tier 0–1: skip this phase.

---

## Phase 4 — ADR Capture (Step 5, Part 2)

After HLD approval:

1. From the approved HLD, identify every design decision — framework choice, pattern selection, tradeoff made, constraint accepted.

2. For each decision that is not already documented in an existing ADR, create a stub at `docs/02-design/technical/adrs/<decision-slug>.md` using `shared/templates/adr-template.md`. Mark status as "DRAFT — architect to complete rationale."

3. Ask the architect:
   > "I've created stubs for [N] decisions I found in the HLD. Are there decisions being made here that aren't visible in the design — things the team discussed, constraints from legal or ops, or choices you ruled out?"

4. Add any architect-supplied decisions as additional ADR stubs.

5. Update `source_artifacts.adr` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` with the ADR paths.

---

## Phase 5 — LLD per Domain (Step 5, Part 3)

For each affected domain identified in Phase 1:

1. Generate the LLD at `docs/02-design/technical/lld/<domain>/<component>.md` following the instructions in Phase 2 of the `generate-docs` skill. Each LLD must include:
   - Component purpose
   - Mermaid class diagram
   - Method signatures with parameters, return types, and preconditions
   - Sequence diagrams for non-trivial flows
   - Facade API surface that other domains call
   - Error modes and their handling

2. Update `docs/02-design/technical/lld/index.md`.

3. For each LLD, ask the architect:
   > "LLD for [domain] is ready. Before approving, check:
   > 1. Are the method signatures precise enough that a developer could generate tests directly from this?
   > 2. Are the preconditions and error modes complete?
   > 3. Does this correctly reflect the decisions in the HLD?
   >
   > Say **"[domain] LLD approved"** to continue."

4. After each LLD is approved, update `source_artifacts.lld` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml`.

Do not proceed to slice decomposition until all LLDs are approved.

After all domain LLDs are approved, post a comment on the GitHub issue:
```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> \
  --body "## ✅ LLDs Approved

Low-Level Designs reviewed and approved for all affected domains: <domain list>.

**LLD(s):** \`docs/02-design/technical/lld/...\`

Proceeding to slice decomposition and test planning."
```

---

## Phase 6 — IaC Planning (Step 6)

If Phase 1 identified IaC changes:

For each affected infrastructure artifact, specify:
- File path (Terraform module, Kubernetes manifest, migration file, config)
- What changes (resource added/modified/removed, migration direction, config key)
- Whether the change is reversible

**Config and secrets externalization (required):**

For any new config or secret introduced by this change:
- Config values must be externalized as environment variables or a config service reference — not hardcoded in source.
- Secrets must be declared as vault references — never as literal values in IaC, migrations, or deploy scripts.

For each new secret, record the vault path and secret manager. If a secret has no vault path assigned, stop: "Secret `<name>` has no vault path. Assign one before proceeding."

Record the IaC plan in `.hitl/current-change.yaml`:
```yaml
iac_plan:
  - path: <file>
    change: <description>
    reversible: true|false
secrets:
  - name: <SECRET_NAME>
    vault_path: <path>
    manager: <aws-secrets-manager|hashicorp-vault|gcp-secret-manager|azure-key-vault|ssm>
```

If no IaC changes: state "No IaC changes identified" and continue.

---

## Phase 7 — Slice Decomposition

This is the architect's core parallelization decision.

### 7a. List the slices

Each slice must touch **exactly one manifest domain**. Present the candidate slices:

```
Proposed slice plan:
  Slice 1: domain [A] — [one-line description of what changes]
  Slice 2: domain [B] — [one-line description of what changes]
  ...
```

### 7b. Check for demoability

For each slice, answer: **"What does the PM see at the end of this slice?"**

A valid answer is one of:
- A user-visible feature or workflow step the PM can exercise in the running app
- A measurable outcome with a defined pass/fail (for infrastructure-only slices: record counts, latency comparison, error-rate delta)

If the answer is "nothing visible yet" — the slice is too narrow. Either extend it to include the user-visible layer, or merge it into an adjacent slice that completes the user-facing story.

Add a `demo:` line to each slice:
```
Slice 1: domain [A] — [description]
  Demo: PM can [specific action] and see [specific result]
```

### 7c. Check for domain independence

For each pair of slices, determine:
- Do they share any mutable state, database tables, or external API contracts?
- Does slice N depend on a schema or interface change introduced by slice M?
- Could both slices be deployed to production independently without breaking anything?

If two slices are NOT independent:
- State which ordering constraint exists
- Mark them as **sequential** (complete and merge slice M before starting slice N)
- Do not allow them to be handed to different developers concurrently

### 7d. Present the final slice plan

```
Slice plan — GH-<N>:
  Slice 1: domain [A] [PARALLEL OK]
    Developer: [to be assigned]
    LLD: docs/02-design/technical/lld/[A]/...
    Demo: PM can [specific action] and see [specific result]
  Slice 2: domain [B] [SEQUENTIAL — after Slice 1]
    Developer: [to be assigned]
    LLD: docs/02-design/technical/lld/[B]/...
    Demo: PM can [specific action] and see [specific result]
```

**STOP. Ask the architect:**
- "Does each slice's Demo answer clearly describe what the PM will see?"
- "Are these slices correctly domain-isolated?"
- "Any hidden dependencies between slices I missed?"
- "Confirm parallelism?"

Do not proceed until the architect confirms the slice plan.

---

## Phase 8 — Test Case Planning (Step 7)

For each confirmed slice:

Using the approved LLD for that domain, produce a concrete test plan:

| Action | Test name | What it covers |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| ADD | `test_<scenario>` | [behavior from LLD] |
| UPDATE | `test_<existing>` | [what changes] |
| REMOVE | `test_<obsolete>` | [why no longer needed] |
| VERIFY (regression) | `test_<existing>` | [what must still pass] |

Also check:
```
/graphify query "past incidents affecting domain: <domain-name>"
```
Fall back to `docs/04-operations/incident-registry.yaml`. For each relevant incident, add a regression test to the plan.

Record the test plan in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` under `tests.plan` (one entry per slice).

Ask the architect: "Is the test plan complete? Anything from domain knowledge or past incidents that should be covered but isn't here?"

---

## Phase 9 — Training Plan Stub (Step 8, conditional)

Check if the change introduces any of:
- A new architectural pattern not already present in the codebase
- A new external system integration
- A new framework or primitive
- A new ML/AI technique
- A refactor that significantly changes how engineers reason about a subsystem

If yes: create a stub at `docs/03-engineering/training/<capability>.md` using `shared/templates/training-plan-template.md`. Link to the relevant LLDs and ADRs. Mark sections as "DRAFT — architect to complete."

If no: state the reason explicitly (e.g., "No training plan required — this extends an existing pattern.").

---

## Phase 10 — Decision Packet Assembly (Step 9)

For each confirmed slice, create `docs/decisions/issue-<N>-slice-<M>.yaml` (or `docs/decisions/issue-<N>.yaml` for a single-slice change). Create the `docs/decisions/` directory first if it does not exist.

Use **exactly** the schema below — do not add, remove, or rename fields. Populate every field from the work completed in prior phases:

```yaml
# docs/decisions/issue-<N>.yaml  (or issue-<N>-slice-<M>.yaml for multi-slice)
issue: <N>                        # GitHub issue number (Phase 1)
slice: null                       # slice number M, or null for single-slice (Phase 7)
title: "<slice description>"      # from Phase 7
change_type: feature              # feature | bugfix | refactor | infrastructure
risk_level: medium                # low | medium | high | critical — derived from tier

domains:
  - <domain-name>                 # exactly one domain per packet (Phase 7)

source_docs:
  prd: "<path>#<requirement-ref>" # PRD path from Phase 1
  hld:
    - "<path>"                    # HLD path from Phase 3
  lld:
    - "<path>"                    # LLD path for this domain from Phase 5
  adr:
    - "<path>"                    # ADR paths from Phase 4 (empty list if none)

tests:
  plan: "<summary>"               # test plan summary from Phase 8
  new_tests:
    - "<tests/file.py::test_name>"  # full list from Phase 8
  registry_updated: false         # developer sets true during /hitl:dev:tdd

incidents:
  checked: true
  relevant: null                  # incident ID from Phase 8, or null

rollout:
  risk: medium                    # same as risk_level
  strategy: "canary 5% → 25% → 100%, 1h soak each"  # placeholder; ops refines
  go_no_go: "<measurable criteria from LLD or incident history>"

roi:
  required: false                 # true if effort > 1 day (Phase 1)
  estimate: null                  # roi_estimate from .hitl/current-change.yaml, or null

impact_brief:
  pm_mental_model: "<one sentence: what changes for the PM>"
  risk_assessment: "<one sentence: main risk>"

approvals:
  architecture: pending           # architect sets to approved after review
```

Field mapping from prior phases:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `issue` | GitHub issue number from Phase 1 |
| `slice` | Slice number M; `null` if single-slice |
| `title` | Slice description from Phase 7 |
| `risk_level` | tier 0–1 → low, 2 → medium, 3–4 → high/critical |
| `domains` | Exactly one domain — the domain for this slice from Phase 7 |
| `source_docs.lld` | LLD path for this domain from Phase 5 |
| `source_docs.adr` | ADR paths from Phase 4 that apply to this slice |
| `tests.plan` | Test plan summary for this slice from Phase 8 |
| `tests.new_tests` | Test list from Phase 8 |
| `incidents.relevant` | Incident ID found in Phase 8, or `null` |
| `rollout.go_no_go` | Criteria from LLD or incident history (Phase 8) |
| `roi.required` | `true` if effort > 1 day (Phase 1) |
| `roi.estimate` | `roi_estimate` from `.hitl/current-change.yaml`, or `null` |

Update `.hitl/current-change.yaml`:
- Add `source_artifacts.decision_packet` paths for all packets
- Set `status: design-review`
- Set `approvals.architecture: pending`

**STOP. For each packet, ask the architect:**
> "Decision packet for slice [M] (domain: [domain]) is ready. Check:
> 1. Is the domain scope correctly limited to one domain?
> 2. Is the LLD path correct?
> 3. Is the test plan complete enough to hand to a developer?
> 4. Is the rollout strategy risk level right?
>
> Say **"packet [M] approved"** to continue."

After all packets are approved:
- Set `approvals.architecture: approved` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml`
- Update `status: implementation-approved`

Post a comment on the GitHub issue signalling the feature is ready for development:
```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> \
  --body "## ✅ Architecture Approved — Ready for Development

Design complete. Decision packet(s) assembled and approved by architect.

**Slices:** <slice plan from Phase 7>
**Decision packet(s):** \`docs/decisions/issue-<N>...\`
**Estimated effort:** <N days>
**Rollout risk:** <level>

Developers can begin implementation. Run \`/hitl:dev:tdd\` with the assigned LLD."
```
