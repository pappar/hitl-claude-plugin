description: Start any change. Say your goal, then pick Fast Track (the fewest steps this change needs) or Full Scale, and tick steps back in or out. Also picks the issue and the HITL workflow (development / brownfield / migration / prd), seeds and pushes .hitl/current-change.yaml, and routes into the workflow. The front door for every change; the session-start gate insists on it before any work.
argument-hint: "[issue number or description]"
disable-model-invocation: true
---

**Before doing anything else:** Check whether `.hitl/` exists in the current directory. If it does not, stop immediately and output this — do not proceed with any steps:

```
This project hasn't been set up for HITL.
To get started, run one of these commands in your project directory:

  /hitl:dev-start-from-prd      new project from a PRD
  /hitl:dev-start-brownfield    adopt HITL on an existing codebase
  /hitl:dev-start-migration     migrate a system
```

---

# Start a Change

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (optional issue number or short description)

This skill is the **enforced front door**. The HITL hooks (`hitl-gate.sh` on session start,
`welcome.sh` on every prompt) inject a directive that no real work may happen until a change is
active for the current branch, and `check-hitl-context.sh` hard-blocks edits until then. This
skill is how that gate is satisfied: it selects the issue, picks the workflow, and writes the
change file.

---

## Step 1 — Don't clobber an active change

Read `.hitl/current-change.yaml`. If it already describes an **active change for the current
branch** (it has a `workflow` or `current_step` block and `expected_branch` matches the current
`git branch --show-current`, or the branch is `issue/N-*` matching `change_id`), stop and say:

> A change is already active on this branch: **<change_id>** (workflow `<id>`, step `<n>/<total>`).
> Continue it, or run `/hitl:dev-switch-context` to move to a different issue.

Only proceed when there is **no** active, branch-matched change.

---

## Step 2 — Choose the issue (insist)

If `$ARGUMENTS` names an issue number, use it. Otherwise ask first: **"What's the goal, in one
sentence, and what does done look like?"** Then list open issues and see whether one already covers it:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 30
```

- If the work has **no issue**, shape one from that sentence; do not proceed to planning without it.
  Offer `/hitl:pm-add-feature` (feature) or `/hitl:pm-report-bug` (bug). A change must trace to an issue.
- Do not invent an issue number. Require an explicit choice.

Read the chosen issue in full:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,labels
```

If the user says "Fast Track" here or at any later point in intake, note it as their preference and
offer it at Step 4. After intake, switching means restarting intake. It does not skip the restatement or the analysis: those are what tell Fast Track which
steps to leave out.

---

## Step 3 — Restate what you understood, and write the stub

**Before anything is read or planned, and before the workflow question.** The goal comes first
because everything downstream, the workflow included, derives from it. Write back what you
understood, in a fixed shape:

| | |
|---|---|
| what you want | the ask, corrected |
| in scope | what this change covers |
| out of scope | what it explicitly does not, so it can be pointed at later |
| definition of done | what counts as delivered, in the requester's terms |

Length comes from the change. A one-line fix has a one-line definition of done. Wait for a
confirmation or a correction; this is the cheapest moment to catch a misread, because everything
downstream derives from this text and a wrong plan is harder to argue with than a wrong sentence.

**Flag a line you cannot check, do not block it.** "The system should be fast" cannot be shown to be
met. Say so, offer a sharper version, take whatever answer comes back, and if the vague line stays,
record that it was flagged as unverifiable and accepted anyway, with a name and a date. That record
does not require you to have been right about the wording, only to have asked.

Then write the stub. It needs the change id, branch and version, not the workflow:

```bash
GEN="ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"; [[ -f "$GEN" ]] || GEN="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"
"$PY" "$GEN" --stub "$CHANGE_ID" "$BRANCH" "$HITL_VERSION" > .hitl/current-change.yaml
```

Fill in the `requirement` block with the confirmed text, `agreed_by` and `agreed_at`.

The stub carries a **provisional tier of 3** and `status: intake`. It does not satisfy the
active-change gate, so source edits stay blocked — correct, since no plan has authorised one yet.
What it does is keep the agreed text if the session dies, feed the analysis, and name the record.

**No tier question here.** The tier is proposed at Step 4 from what the analysis found. Asking now
means asking before the evidence exists, which is what tiered a one-line shell script change up to a
three and a half hour path (#97).

---

## Step 3b — Determine the workflow (read the issue, then confirm)

Classify the work into exactly one workflow, **state your reasoning**, and confirm with the user
before writing anything:

| Workflow | Choose when | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `prd`        | Greenfield project being stood up from a PRD; no `docs/system-manifest.yaml` yet | `/hitl:dev-start-from-prd` |
| `brownfield` | Existing codebase not yet onboarded to HITL (no manifest / registries) | `/hitl:dev-start-brownfield` |
| `migration`  | Porting or consolidating a system from a source codebase into this target | `/hitl:dev-start-migration` |
| `development`| **Most issues** — a feature, bug fix, or refactor in an already-documented component | `/hitl:dev-apply-change` |
| `docs`       | The change touches **nothing but documentation** — no source, tests, or IaC | `/hitl:dev-generate-docs` |
| `release`    | Publishing a version to users — the change *is* shipping, not building | **follow the 12-step release table in `dev-practices/workflow-steps.md`**; `/hitl:dev-verification-review` at step 5 |

Heuristics from the issue: labels (`bug`/`enhancement` → development; `documentation`/`docs` → docs), wording ("migrate",
"port", "consolidate" → migration; "onboard", "adopt HITL", "no docs yet" → brownfield), and
whether `docs/system-manifest.yaml` exists (absent on a real project → prd/brownfield).

**The `docs` workflow is only for changes that touch nothing but docs.** Docs *and* code is a `development` change (the spine already reconciles docs), which stops `docs` becoming a way to skip the gates on real code. Its `doc_review` gate is domain-routed: Architect for design docs, PM for product, Ops for runbooks. At its final `merge` step set top-level `status: merged` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml`, so the file does not linger and satisfy the gate for the next change.

State: "This looks like a **<workflow>** change because …. Proceed with the <workflow> workflow?"
Wait for confirmation (or correction) before Step 3c.

---

## Step 3c — Run the impact analysis, inside this intake

Follow `dev-apply-change` Steps 2 and 3 from its file (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-apply-change/SKILL.md` under the
plugin root; `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-apply-change/SKILL.md` in source). Do not invoke the command: its frontmatter
forbids model invocation, and handing it to the person splits intake in two (#130). Step 3 reads the
stub, asks the one security question, writes `.hitl/impact/<change_id>.yaml` with the acceptance
criteria, and resurfaces overlapping skips. **It is not a step in the plan**; it produces the plan.

Do not continue until the record exists and is non-empty: a change file naming a record that is not
there is a blocking error, because a second artifact is only safe when something notices its absence.

---

## Step 4 — Propose the tier, then offer two options

### The tier, from what the analysis found

Propose one, say which finding drives it, and **wait for a human to confirm or correct it**. Keep the
proposal: `export HITL_TIER_PROPOSED=<n>` for Step 6, which writes it as `tier_proposed`. Record
`tier_set_by` and `tier_reason`, and clear `tier_provisional`. Leaving it set is a blocking error:
it means nobody confirmed.

The evidence is in the record now, so the proposal cites it rather than the issue's wording: three
dependent areas and a data migration is a different change from one flagged file with no callers.

Where protection actually changes, from the catalog: **3 → 2** takes `packet`, `arch_review`,
`qa_verify` and `rollout` off `floor`; **2 → 1** moves only `integration_verify`. `deploy`,
`promote`, the test-first cycle and the retrospective never demote. So **declaring 2 instead of 3 is
the consequential call.**

### Two options

Size the plan from the record, passing the tier the human just confirmed. The sizer requires it
and will not read one from the record: the impact analysis is not allowed to set a tier, and two
sources for that field disagree.

```bash
SZ="ci/first-pass/size_plan.py"; [[ -f "$SZ" ]] || SZ="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/size_plan.py"
"$PY" "$SZ" ".hitl/impact/$CHANGE_ID.yaml" "$TIER" fast
```

**Write the outcomes back into the record.** `size_plan` returns `outcomes` — what each rule decided
and why. Append it to `.hitl/impact/<change_id>.yaml` as `rule_outcomes`; without it the retrospective
cannot ask whether a rule was right. It is written here, not by the analysis, because sizing needs the
tier and the tier does not exist until this step.

Show both, and **list what Fast Track leaves out, one step per line, every time.** Do not wait to
be asked: two counts and a comma list read as a summary, not a choice (a 2.12.1 session never showed
a checkbox until the person asked).

```
This change reaches: 1 area, no dependents, no interface or data change.

  Fast Track   16 steps   what this change needs before it ships
  Full Scale   26 steps   everything that applies to a change of this shape

  Fast Track leaves out (most consequential first):
    Baseline measurement        a before-number, so "faster" is measured
    Decision packet             the decision and alternatives, recorded
    Design verification         someone tries to break the design early
    Design update               the design catches up with what building taught
    Code verification           someone tries to break the implementation
    ROI estimate                a stated reason this is worth building
    Test review                 a person checks the tests assert the right thing
    Refactor                    code left in shape for the next person
    30-day ROI check            whether it was worth building
    90-day ROI check            the longer-term effect, looked at

  Always stays: the failing test and making it pass, the integration check, deploy,
  promote and the retrospective.

Recommended: Fast Track. Nothing it drops is protecting something this change touches.
```

Each line is the step's name as a person would say it, not the catalog label (`VfyDsn`), and a
short form of its `protects` line, ordered by `forgo_cost` then catalog order. "Always stays" is every
`locked` step from the sizer. One line on which is recommended and why; **the recommendation is
advice**, and taking Full Scale is not recorded. Write the two names exactly as shown, capitalized:
a different spelling each time is how a name stops being findable (#125).

If the two options come out the same, say so and do not offer a choice.

### Ask with checkboxes

Then ask with the `AskUserQuestion` tool. It draws the options as a menu the person moves through
with the arrow keys, and `multiSelect` draws checkboxes. Do not ask "which do you want?" in prose.

**First, the plan.** One single-select question:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `header` | `Plan` |
| `question` | `Which plan for <change_id>?` |
| options | `Fast Track (Recommended)`, `Full Scale`, `Pick steps myself`, with the recommended one first and carrying "(Recommended)" |
| `description` | Fast Track: "16 steps: what this change needs before it ships. You can tick any step back in next." Full Scale: "26 steps: everything that applies." Pick steps myself: "Start from Fast Track, then choose what to add back and what to leave out." |
| `preview` | on Fast Track and Full Scale, that option's ordered step list with the left-out steps under it, so moving between the two shows the difference |

**Then, for Fast Track and for Pick steps myself, the checkboxes.** One `multiSelect` call over every step Full Scale has and
Fast Track does not:

- `question`: `Fast Track leaves these out. Tick any you want to keep.` With more than one question,
  number them (`... leaves these out (1 of 3). ...`): the tool rejects a call whose question texts
  repeat, or whose option labels repeat within a question.
- `header`: `Add back`, or `Add back 1` to `Add back 4` when there is more than one question.
- One option per step, in the same order as the list. `label` is the step's name (five words at
  most); `description` is its `protects` line and what leaving it out costs ("Leaving it out costs:
  medium").
- Four options per question, four questions per call: sixteen boxes. A question needs at least two
  options, so split five as three and two, not four and one. Past sixteen, box the sixteen most
  consequential, name the rest in the last question's text, and take names typed into the "Other"
  box the tool adds.
- Nothing ticked is Fast Track as proposed. A ticked step is kept. An unticked one is recorded in
  Step 4b: `not_applicable` with the rule's reason, or `defer` when the sizer lists it under `proposed`.

**For Pick steps myself, a second checkbox screen** after the "Add back" one: `Leave out any of these?`
(header `Leave out`), over the steps in the plan a person may lighten. That is every step that is
not `locked`, not `no_omit` and not `issue` (intake has already done it), lowest `forgo_cost` first, so the cheapest to drop comes first. A
ticked step goes through the Step 4b menu below, which says what it becomes. Offer the same screen
after Fast Track when someone says they want it lighter still. Full Scale asks nothing more.

**Steps that always stay are never checkboxes.** Dropping one needs a named person to accept the
risk, not a tick. List them, and say how to ask for a risk-accepted skip. Without the
`AskUserQuestion` tool (a host without it, a non-interactive run), print the same lists numbered and
take the numbers typed back; never drop the list.

**Print the full ordered plan on request** ("show me every step"), and always in full for a workflow
of 10 steps or fewer.

---

## Step 4b — Record the choice (First Pass, FR-29)

**First Pass is how the choice at Step 4 is recorded**: the internal name for the skip record and its
validator. People see Fast Track and Full Scale; never say "First Pass" to them. Not opt-in (#97).

**The pre-selection comes from the rules, not from the tier.** `size_plan.py` has already decided
what applies and what is needed now, from what this change reaches. Present the steps outside the
chosen option pre-selected, each carrying the finding that decided it as its reason: "no interface
files in this change", "3 dependents". Let **one confirmation record the lot.**

Those entries take the `not_applicable` disposition — the rules determined the step does not apply,
which is a different fact from a person choosing to skip it; otherwise Fast Track would record a named
human declining twenty-odd steps they never looked at.

A rule may never retire a load-bearing step. `not_applicable` on a `floor` or `no_omit` step is a
non-waivable block (`RULE_OVER_FLOOR`); those are dropped by a named person accepting the risk, or
not at all. The one exception is a **conditional** step (`cond:`) whose activator did not fire: it
was never in the plan, so the sizer records it `not_applicable` (#102). The gate reads the impact
record, not the ledger: it must name this change and workflow, its `rule_outcomes` must match the
rules run on its own findings (#124) and show `applies: false`, and the security steps need
`security_sensitive` answered (silence is not a no); else `COND_UNCONFIRMED`, `RECORD_UNIDENTIFIED`
or `RECORD_CONTRADICTED`, all non-waivable. Active, it is protected like any other step.

Pre-selected is not pre-recorded. **Nothing is written until the human confirms**; doing nothing runs
the full plan (`keep` is the default, CR-1), and the actor on every record is the person who confirmed.

**The checkboxes in Step 4 are the menu.** Ask once (brief mode, not a step-by-step interview).
Steps the RULES excluded (`excluded`) are pre-selected `not_applicable`; an active conditional step
Fast Track leaves out (`proposed`, e.g. baseline on an API change) is pre-selected `defer` by the
confirming person, never `not_applicable` (#129). Both are "Add back" boxes only. A step ticked under
"Leave out" is a person lightening beyond that; its `crit` (catalog, resolved against the `tier`) says
what it can become:

| step type | options offered |
|---|---|
| `ceremony` | keep · starter\* · skip (defer / decline) |
| `standard` | keep · starter\* · defer · decline |
| `standard` + `no_omit` (TDD RED/GREEN) | keep · starter — *never defer/decline* |
| `floor` | keep · *request risk-accepted skip* |

\*starter offered only for steps in the registry (`ci/first-pass/starters.py`); `keep` is the default.

For a ticked step, use its starter when it has one, otherwise `decline` for a ceremony step and
`defer` for a standard one. Say which in one line per step ("Test plan: a thin version now, marked
to enhance later"), and ask only if the person wants a different one. Then say once: **"N steps
left out. No issues opened. One line at the top of #N lists them; they come back at the next change
in this area."** A ticket is filed only when the person says "file this one" (one, for that step).

**This step elicits choices; it does not write the ledger.** The change file does not exist yet — Step 6
creates it — so recording here would write to a stale or absent file that Step 6 then overwrites. Capture
the choices and let the generator apply them:

```bash
# Only NON-keep steps go in. An absent step means keep. `actor` is the accountable human, not the agent.
cat > .hitl/first-pass-choices.json <<'JSON'
{
  "actor": "name@team",
  "choices": {
    "roi":   { "disposition": "decline", "reason": "internal tool; ROI self-evident" },
    "figma": { "disposition": "defer",   "reason": "no UI change", "followup_ref": "GH-123" },
    "docs":  { "disposition": "starter", "reason": "thin first pass" }
  }
}
JSON
```

Rules that still apply when collecting the choices:
1. **Floor** — a `floor` skip requires the accountable role's risk-accepted `ack_by` + reason, and (for a
   step mapping to a hard gate) a linked `waiver_ref`. A skip is **not** a waiver. Put both in the entry.
2. **Starter** — write the honest-minimal artifact from `starters.py` (e.g. acceptance criteria = "a working
   version of the system"), mark it `needs-enhancement`, record its path. Listed on the issue's skipped
   line like a defer; no ticket unless asked for.
3. **Defer** — leave `followup_ref` out; the generator sets `issue:<N>` (the change's own issue, where
   Step 6b writes the notice). A ticket ref goes there only when the person asked for one.

If the validator is missing, say so **before** collecting any choices — the ledger is unenforced without it:

```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(python3 -c "import json,os;d=json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json')));[print(i['installPath']) for i in d.get('plugins',{}).get('hitl@hitl',[]) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(i.get('installPath',''),'.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))]" 2>/dev/null | head -1)}"
CHK="ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || CHK="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || echo "⚠ Skip-record validator not found: run /hitl:dev-update to install it. Do NOT record skips until it is present: the ledger is unenforced without it."
```

Run the change under **brief mode** ([`shared/first-pass/brief.md`](../../shared/first-pass/brief.md) —
say less, ask less, never re-ask what intake already settled) and the **reduced-friction permission policy**
([`shared/first-pass/permissions.md`](../../shared/first-pass/permissions.md)); use the neutral /
respectful language in [`shared/first-pass/language.md`](../../shared/first-pass/language.md).

> **Resurfacing does not happen here.** `resurface.surface()` matches unresolved skips against the new
> change's domains and `allowed_paths`, and neither is known until the workflow's own impact step fills

> exists. See the worked example at
> [`docs/examples/first-pass/`](https://github.com/Prasad-Apparaju/hitl-dev-platform/tree/main/docs/examples/first-pass).

---

## Step 5 — Create the branch

```bash
N=<issue-number>
TITLE=$(gh issue view "$N" --json title -q .title \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | cut -c1-50 | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//')
# cut BEFORE sed: truncating after the trim re-introduces the trailing hyphen the trim
# just removed, so every title over 50 chars yields `issue/N-…-` (plugin issue #26).
BRANCH="issue/${N}-${TITLE}"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$BRANCH"
```

---

## Step 6 — Seed and write `.hitl/current-change.yaml`

Generate the embedded `workflow` block **from the catalog** (do not hand-write the steps — that
is how drift starts). Run this generator, which copies the chosen workflow's steps, marks the
first step `current` and the rest `open`, and stamps the versions:

```bash
WF=<development|brownfield|migration|migration_review|prd|release|docs>
CHANGE_ID="GH-<N>"
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
# Resolve a working Python (Windows-safe: python3 is the MS Store stub there). See issue #14.
PY=""; for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c "import sys" >/dev/null 2>&1 && { PY="$c"; break; }; done
[[ -n "$PY" ]] || { echo "No usable Python found (need python3, python, or py on PATH)."; exit 1; }
HITL_VERSION=$(cat "$ROOT/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" 2>/dev/null \
  | "$PY" -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('version','0.0.0'))" 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0")

TIER=2                       # confirmed at Step 4 — never assume it
TIER_SET_BY=""               # required when TIER <= 1, OR when TIER is above a light proposal (#111)
TIER_REASON=""               # one line on why; HITL_TIER_PROPOSED (Step 4) tells the generator the proposal
CHOICES=".hitl/first-pass-choices.json"   # written by Step 4b; absent ⇒ full plan, no First Pass

# Write via a temp file: a generator that dies partway through `> file` leaves a truncated change
# file behind, and a truncated change file reads as "no active change" to the gate.
# The generator lives at ci/first-pass/gen_change.py — resolved the same way as the validators,
# so it works from source and from the installed plugin.
GEN="ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"; [[ -f "$GEN" ]] || GEN="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"
"$PY" "$GEN" "$WF" "$CHANGE_ID" "$BRANCH" "$HITL_VERSION" "$TIER" "$CHOICES" \
     "$TIER_SET_BY" "$TIER_REASON" > .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp
rc=$?

# Replace the live file ONLY on success. The generator refuses on several paths (tier attribution,
# malformed choices, catalog not found), and every refusal writes nothing to stdout — so an
# unconditional mv would drop an EMPTY file over the real change file, which is precisely the
# clobber this temp file exists to prevent. The choices are the user's input; do not delete them
# on a failure they will want to retry.
if [[ $rc -eq 0 && -s .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp ]]; then
  mv .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp .hitl/current-change.yaml
  rm -f .hitl/first-pass-choices.json     # consumed; the change file is now the record
else
  rm -f .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp
  echo "Change file NOT written (generator exit $rc). Existing change file and your step choices are untouched." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Show the resulting file to the user. Then complete the remaining required fields for the change
(`source_artifacts.issue`, `manifest.domain`, `allowed_paths`, approvals) per the
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/templates/change-context.schema.yaml`, or note they will be filled by the
workflow's own steps.

> **The roll-up is written at Step 6b, below**, not here: the change file has to exist first. Entries
> recorded before the workflow declares its area are marked project-wide; the `development` route
> narrows them at its impact step.

---

## Step 6b — Certify the ledger

Only meaningful once the change file exists. Run it **before** the Step 7 commit, so nothing
uncertified is ever pushed:

**Certify without `--rollup`.** The roll-up is appended after the check, below, so a check that read
it first would warn on every intake, and a check that always warns gets ignored.

It must exit 0. A silent skip, an unauthorized floor skip, a TDD omission, or a lightened step with no
`first_pass` flag exits 2 and is non-waivable.

Then fold the skips into the durable roll-up so they survive the next intake replacing this file.
**Every workflow does this** (CR-10 is project-wide, and the onboarding and docs routes never declare
a manifest domain at all):

```bash
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is unset in the Bash tool; a bare "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/..." becomes "/...".
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(python3 -c "import json,os;d=json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json')));[print(i['installPath']) for i in d.get('plugins',{}).get('hitl@hitl',[]) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(i.get('installPath',''),'.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))]" 2>/dev/null | head -1)}"
CHK="ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"; RS="ci/first-pass/resurface.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || CHK="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$RS" ]] || RS="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/resurface.py"
python3 "$CHK" .hitl/current-change.yaml
python3 "$RS" --change .hitl/current-change.yaml --rollup .hitl/skip-ledger.yaml --append
SL="ci/first-pass/skipped_line.py"
[[ -f "$SL" ]] || SL="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/skipped_line.py"
python3 "$SL" --change .hitl/current-change.yaml --apply
```

The last line is the Step 4b notice: one line between markers at the top of the issue body naming every
step left out, regenerated from the ledger, idempotent; nothing else is posted or filed for a skip. Exit
3: `gh` could not edit the issue; say so and carry on, the ledger is the record. Exit 2: no issue number
(id not `GH-N`, so `followup_ref` is empty and certify warned `DEFER_NO_FOLLOWUP`); say the left-out
steps are in the ledger only, and re-run with `--issue N` if there is an issue.

With no area declared yet, entries record as **project-wide** and resurface at any later change until
resolved; the impact step reads them and does not append (`dev-apply-change` Step 3). The append is
idempotent on `(change_id, step)`. If `ci/first-pass/` is absent, say so plainly and tell the
user to run `/hitl:dev-update` — that state means the skip ledger is uncertified for **every** change on
the project, not just this one.

---

## Step 7 — Commit and push the change file

Anchor the change to this branch so anyone who picks it up resumes from the right context:

```bash
git add .hitl/current-change.yaml
git commit -m "chore(hitl): start <change_id> (<workflow>) — seed change context"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true   # push if a remote exists

## Step 8 — Route into the workflow

Hand off to the workflow's own skill and follow the breadcrumb from there:

- `development` → **`/hitl:dev-apply-change <N>`** (its Steps 4 to 8: doc plan, test plan, IaC review, summary; the impact analysis already ran at Step 3c)
- `brownfield`  → **`/hitl:dev-start-brownfield`**
- `migration`   → **`/hitl:dev-start-migration`**
- `prd`         → **`/hitl:dev-start-from-prd`**

As each step completes, update the matching step's `status` to `done` and the next step's to
`current` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` (set `current_step` to match) so the breadcrumb advances.

## Important Rules

- A change must trace to a GitHub issue — never proceed without one.
- Never hand-write the `workflow.steps` block; always seed it from the bundled `workflows.yaml`
  catalog (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/workflows.yaml`) via the Step 6 generator.
- One active change per branch. Don't clobber an existing active change — switch context instead.
