description: Start work on a change the right way — pick a GitHub issue, determine the correct HITL workflow (development / brownfield / migration / prd), show its full step plan, seed and push the self-describing .hitl/current-change.yaml, then route into the workflow. This is the front door for every change; the session-start gate insists on it before any work.
argument-hint: "[issue number or description]"
disable-model-invocation: true
---

**Before doing anything else:** Check whether `.hitl/` exists in the current directory. If it does not, stop immediately and output this — do not proceed with any steps:

```
This project hasn't been set up for HITL.
To get started, run one of these commands in your project directory:

  /hitl:dev-start-from-prd      new project from a PRD
  /hitl:dev-start-brownfield    adopt HITL on an existing codebase
  /hitl:dev-start-migration     migrate a system
```

---

# Start a Change

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (optional issue number or short description)

This skill is the **enforced front door**. The HITL hooks (`hitl-gate.sh` on session start,
`welcome.sh` on every prompt) inject a directive that no real work may happen until a change is
active for the current branch, and `check-hitl-context.sh` hard-blocks edits until then. This
skill is how that gate is satisfied: it selects the issue, picks the workflow, and writes the
change file.

---

## Step 1 — Don't clobber an active change

Read `.hitl/current-change.yaml`. If it already describes an **active change for the current
branch** (it has a `workflow` or `current_step` block and `expected_branch` matches the current
`git branch --show-current`, or the branch is `issue/N-*` matching `change_id`), stop and say:

> A change is already active on this branch: **<change_id>** (workflow `<id>`, step `<n>/<total>`).
> Continue it, or run `/hitl:dev-switch-context` to move to a different issue.

Only proceed when there is **no** active, branch-matched change.

---

## Step 2 — Choose the issue (insist)

If `$ARGUMENTS` names an issue number, use it. Otherwise list open issues and ask the user to pick one:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 30
```

- If the user describes work that has **no issue**, do not proceed to planning. Offer to create one:
  `/hitl:pm-add-feature` (feature) or `/hitl:pm-report-bug` (bug). A change must trace to an issue.
- Do not invent an issue number. Require an explicit choice.

Read the chosen issue in full:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,labels
```

---

## Step 3 — Determine the workflow (read the issue, then confirm)

Classify the work into exactly one workflow, **state your reasoning**, and confirm with the user
before writing anything:

| Workflow | Choose when | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `prd`        | Greenfield project being stood up from a PRD; no `docs/system-manifest.yaml` yet | `/hitl:dev-start-from-prd` |
| `brownfield` | Existing codebase not yet onboarded to HITL (no manifest / registries) | `/hitl:dev-start-brownfield` |
| `migration`  | Porting or consolidating a system from a source codebase into this target | `/hitl:dev-start-migration` |
| `development`| **Most issues** — a feature, bug fix, or refactor in an already-documented component | `/hitl:dev-apply-change` |
| `docs`       | The change touches **nothing but documentation** — no source, tests, or IaC | `/hitl:dev-generate-docs` |
| `release`    | Publishing a version to users — the change *is* shipping, not building | **follow the 12-step release table in `dev-practices/workflow-steps.md`**; `/hitl:dev-verification-review` at step 5 |

Heuristics from the issue: labels (`bug`/`enhancement` → development; `documentation`/`docs` → docs), wording ("migrate",
"port", "consolidate" → migration; "onboard", "adopt HITL", "no docs yet" → brownfield), and
whether `docs/system-manifest.yaml` exists (absent on a real project → prd/brownfield).

**The `docs` workflow is only for changes that touch nothing but docs.** Docs *and* code is a `development` change (the spine already reconciles docs), which stops `docs` becoming a way to skip the gates on real code. Its `doc_review` gate is domain-routed: Architect for design docs, PM for product, Ops for runbooks. At its final `merge` step set top-level `status: merged` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml`, so the file does not linger and satisfy the gate for the next change.

State: "This looks like a **<workflow>** change because …. Proceed with the <workflow> workflow?"
Wait for confirmation (or correction) before Step 4.

---

## Step 3b — Restate what you understood, and write the stub

**Before anything is read or planned.** Write back what you understood, in a fixed shape:

| | |
|---|---|
| what you want | the ask, corrected |
| in scope | what this change covers |
| out of scope | what it explicitly does not, so it can be pointed at later |
| definition of done | what counts as delivered, in the requester's terms |

Length comes from the change. A one-line fix has a one-line definition of done. Wait for a
confirmation or a correction; this is the cheapest moment to catch a misread, because everything
downstream derives from this text and a wrong plan is harder to argue with than a wrong sentence.

**The definition of done is not the plan restated.** The plan is how the work gets done; this is
what counts as delivered, in the requester's own words. A completed plan does not prove the thing
does what was asked.

**Flag a line you cannot check, do not block it.** "The system should be fast" cannot be shown to be
met. Say so, offer a sharper version, take whatever answer comes back, and if the vague line stays,
record that it was flagged as unverifiable and accepted anyway, with a name and a date. That record
does not require you to have been right about the wording, only to have asked.

Then write the stub:

```bash
GEN="ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"; [[ -f "$GEN" ]] || GEN="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"
"$PY" "$GEN" --stub "$CHANGE_ID" "$BRANCH" "$HITL_VERSION" > .hitl/current-change.yaml
```

Fill in the `requirement` block with the confirmed text, `agreed_by` and `agreed_at`.

The stub carries a **provisional tier of 3** and `status: intake`. It does not satisfy the
active-change gate, so source edits stay blocked — correct, since no plan has authorised one yet.
What it does is keep the agreed text if the session dies, feed the analysis, and name the record.

**No tier question here.** The tier is proposed at Step 4 from what the analysis found. Asking now
means asking before the evidence exists, which is what tiered a one-line shell script change up to a
three and a half hour path (#97).

---

## Step 3c — Run the impact analysis

Call `/hitl:dev-apply-change`. It reads the stub, works out what this change reaches, writes
`.hitl/impact/<change_id>.yaml`, translates the definition of done into acceptance criteria, and
returns. **It is not a step in the plan** — it is what produces the plan.

Do not continue until the record exists and is non-empty. A change file naming a record that is not
there is a blocking error, because a second artifact is only safe when something notices its absence.

---

## Step 4 — Propose the tier, then offer two options

### The tier, from what the analysis found

Propose one, say which finding drives it, and **wait for a human to confirm or correct it**. Record
`tier_set_by` and `tier_reason`, and clear `tier_provisional`. Leaving it set is a blocking error:
it means nobody confirmed.

The evidence is in the record now, so the proposal cites it rather than the issue's wording. Three
dependent areas and a data migration is a different change from one flagged file with no callers,
and the words in the title do not distinguish them.

Where protection actually changes, from the catalog: **3 → 2** takes `packet`, `arch_review`,
`qa_verify` and `rollout` off `floor`; **2 → 1** moves only `integration_verify`. `deploy`,
`promote`, the test-first cycle and the retrospective never demote. So **declaring 2 instead of 3 is
the consequential call.**

### Two options

Size the plan from the record, passing the tier the human just confirmed. The sizer requires it
and will not read one from the record: the impact analysis is not allowed to set a tier, and two
sources for that field disagree.

```bash
SZ="ci/first-pass/size_plan.py"; [[ -f "$SZ" ]] || SZ="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/size_plan.py"
"$PY" "$SZ" ".hitl/impact/$CHANGE_ID.yaml" "$TIER" fast
```

**Write the outcomes back into the record.** `size_plan` returns `outcomes` — what each rule decided
and why. Append it to `.hitl/impact/<change_id>.yaml` as `rule_outcomes`. Without it the record says
what was found and never what was concluded from it, and the retrospective has nothing to compare
against: you cannot ask whether a rule was right if nobody wrote down what it decided.

It is written here, not by the analysis, because sizing needs the tier and the tier does not exist
until this step.

Show both, and the difference:

```
This change reaches: 3 areas, 1 published interface, a data migration.

  Fast track   21 steps — what this change's own facts call for
  Full scale   31 steps — everything that applies to a change of this shape

  The 10 extra: Figma, ROI, training, design review, code review, refactor,
  conventions, test review, and both ROI checkpoints.

Recommended: fast track. Nothing it drops is protecting something this change touches.
```

One line on which is recommended and why. **The recommendation is advice** — taking full scale
instead is not recorded.

Say what each step protects when asked, from `protects` in the catalog. Order anything outside the
fast track by `forgo_cost`, so the most consequential omission is the first one a person sees.

**Print the full ordered list on request** ("show me every step"), and always in full for a workflow
of 10 steps or fewer, where a phase summary would be longer than the list it replaces.

---

## Step 4b — Record the choice (First Pass, FR-29)

**First Pass is how the choice at Step 4 is recorded.** It is not a separate offer and no longer
opt-in: every change is shown a proposal and confirms or adjusts it. Full scale is simply the answer
set where nothing is dropped. This is the third root cause in #97 — the one feature built for this
problem had to be asked for by someone who already knew it existed.

**The pre-selection comes from the rules, not from the tier.** `size_plan.py` has already decided
what applies and what is needed now, from what this change reaches. Present the steps outside the
chosen option pre-selected, each carrying the finding that decided it as its reason: "no interface
files in this change", "3 dependents". Let **one confirmation record the lot.**

Those entries take the `not_applicable` disposition — the rules determined the step does not apply,
which is a different fact from a person choosing to skip it. Without that distinction a fast track
records a named human declining twenty-odd steps they never looked at, and the retrospective reads
that back as what was left out and why.

A rule may never retire a load-bearing step. `not_applicable` on a `floor` or `no_omit` step is a
non-waivable block (`RULE_OVER_FLOOR`); those are dropped by a named person accepting the risk, or
not at all. The one exception is a **conditional** step (`cond:` — security design review, CVE
audit, penetration test, baseline) whose activator did not fire: it was never in the plan for the
floor to protect, so the sizer records it `not_applicable` with the reason (#102). The gate takes
that from the impact record, not the ledger: the record must carry `rule_outcomes` for the step
with `applies: false`, and for the security steps must answer `security_sensitive` (silence is not
a no), else `COND_UNCONFIRMED` (non-waivable). Active, it is protected like any other step.

Pre-selected is not pre-recorded. **Nothing is written until the human confirms**, and doing nothing
still runs the full plan — `keep` remains the default disposition (CR-1). The actor on every resulting
record is the person who confirmed, never the agent.

**Present the disposition menu ONCE** (brief mode — not a step-by-step interview). Each step's `crit`
(from the catalog, resolved against this change's `tier`) constrains its options:

Steps the RULES excluded are pre-selected as `not_applicable` and are not part of this menu; the
menu is for what a person is choosing to lighten beyond that.

| step type | options offered |
|---|---|
| `ceremony` | keep · starter\* · skip (defer / decline) |
| `standard` | keep · starter\* · defer · decline |
| `standard` + `no_omit` (TDD RED/GREEN) | keep · starter — *never defer/decline* |
| `floor` | keep · *request risk-accepted skip* |

\*starter offered only for steps in the registry (`ci/first-pass/starters.py`); `keep` is the default.

**This step elicits choices; it does not write the ledger.** The change file does not exist yet — Step 6
creates it — so recording here would write to a stale or absent file that Step 6 then overwrites. Capture
the choices and let the generator apply them:

```bash
# Only NON-keep steps go in. An absent step means keep. `actor` is the accountable human, not the agent.
cat > .hitl/first-pass-choices.json <<'JSON'
{
  "actor": "name@team",
  "choices": {
    "roi":   { "disposition": "decline", "reason": "internal tool; ROI self-evident" },
    "figma": { "disposition": "defer",   "reason": "no UI change", "followup_ref": "GH-123" },
    "docs":  { "disposition": "starter", "reason": "thin first pass" }
  }
}
JSON
```

Rules that still apply when collecting the choices:
1. **Floor** — a `floor` skip requires the accountable role's risk-accepted `ack_by` + reason, and (for a
   step mapping to a hard gate) a linked `waiver_ref`. A skip is **not** a waiver. Put both in the entry.
2. **Starter** — write the honest-minimal artifact from `starters.py` (e.g. acceptance criteria = "a working
   version of the system"), mark it `needs-enhancement`, record its path; seed a fast-follow to *enhance* it.
3. **Defer** — seed a linked fast-follow ticket and put its ref in `followup_ref`.

If the validator is missing, say so **before** collecting any choices — the ledger is unenforced without it:

```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(python3 -c "import json,os;d=json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json')));[print(i['installPath']) for i in d.get('plugins',{}).get('hitl@hitl',[]) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(i.get('installPath',''),'.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))]" 2>/dev/null | head -1)}"
CHK="ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || CHK="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || echo "⚠ First Pass validator not found: run /hitl:dev-update to install it. Do NOT record skips until it is present: the ledger is unenforced without it."
```

Certification happens in **Step 6b**, once the change file exists and there is something real to certify.

Run the change under **brief mode** ([`shared/first-pass/brief.md`](../../shared/first-pass/brief.md) —
say less, ask less, never re-ask what intake already settled) and the **reduced-friction permission policy**
([`shared/first-pass/permissions.md`](../../shared/first-pass/permissions.md)); use the neutral /
respectful language in [`shared/first-pass/language.md`](../../shared/first-pass/language.md).

> **Resurfacing does not happen here.** `resurface.surface()` matches unresolved skips against the new
> change's domains and `allowed_paths`, and neither is known until the workflow's own impact step fills
> them. Called at change start it always matches nothing. It belongs at the impact step, where scope
> exists. See the worked example at
> [`docs/examples/first-pass/`](https://github.com/Prasad-Apparaju/hitl-dev-platform/tree/main/docs/examples/first-pass).

---

## Step 5 — Create the branch

```bash
N=<issue-number>
TITLE=$(gh issue view "$N" --json title -q .title \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | cut -c1-50 | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//')
# cut BEFORE sed: truncating after the trim re-introduces the trailing hyphen the trim
# just removed, so every title over 50 chars yields `issue/N-…-` (plugin issue #26).
BRANCH="issue/${N}-${TITLE}"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$BRANCH"
```

---

## Step 6 — Seed and write `.hitl/current-change.yaml`

Generate the embedded `workflow` block **from the catalog** (do not hand-write the steps — that
is how drift starts). Run this generator, which copies the chosen workflow's steps, marks the
first step `current` and the rest `open`, and stamps the versions:

```bash
WF=<development|brownfield|migration|migration_review|prd|release|docs>
CHANGE_ID="GH-<N>"
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
# Resolve a working Python (Windows-safe: python3 is the MS Store stub there). See issue #14.
PY=""; for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c "import sys" >/dev/null 2>&1 && { PY="$c"; break; }; done
[[ -n "$PY" ]] || { echo "No usable Python found (need python3, python, or py on PATH)."; exit 1; }
HITL_VERSION=$(cat "$ROOT/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" 2>/dev/null \
  | "$PY" -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('version','0.0.0'))" 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0")

TIER=2                       # from Step 3b — never assume it
TIER_SET_BY=""               # required when TIER <= 1: the human who made the call
TIER_REASON=""               # required when TIER <= 1: one line on why it qualifies
CHOICES=".hitl/first-pass-choices.json"   # written by Step 4b; absent ⇒ full plan, no First Pass

# Write via a temp file: a generator that dies partway through `> file` leaves a truncated change
# file behind, and a truncated change file reads as "no active change" to the gate.
# The generator lives at ci/first-pass/gen_change.py — resolved the same way as the validators,
# so it works from source and from the installed plugin.
GEN="ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"; [[ -f "$GEN" ]] || GEN="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/gen_change.py"
"$PY" "$GEN" "$WF" "$CHANGE_ID" "$BRANCH" "$HITL_VERSION" "$TIER" "$CHOICES" \
     "$TIER_SET_BY" "$TIER_REASON" > .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp
rc=$?

# Replace the live file ONLY on success. The generator refuses on several paths (tier attribution,
# malformed choices, catalog not found), and every refusal writes nothing to stdout — so an
# unconditional mv would drop an EMPTY file over the real change file, which is precisely the
# clobber this temp file exists to prevent. The choices are the user's input; do not delete them
# on a failure they will want to retry.
if [[ $rc -eq 0 && -s .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp ]]; then
  mv .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp .hitl/current-change.yaml
  rm -f .hitl/first-pass-choices.json     # consumed; the change file is now the record
else
  rm -f .hitl/current-change.yaml.tmp
  echo "Change file NOT written (generator exit $rc). Existing change file and your First Pass choices are untouched." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Show the resulting file to the user. Then complete the remaining required fields for the change
(`source_artifacts.issue`, `manifest.domain`, `allowed_paths`, approvals) per the
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/templates/change-context.schema.yaml`, or note they will be filled by the
workflow's own steps.

> **The roll-up is written at Step 6b, below**, not here: the change file has to exist first. Entries
> recorded before the workflow declares its area are marked project-wide; the `development` route
> narrows them at its impact step.

---

## Step 6b — Certify the ledger

Only meaningful once the change file exists. Run it **before** the Step 7 commit, so nothing
uncertified is ever pushed:


**No `--rollup` here, deliberately.** The roll-up is written at the impact step, once the change knows
its own area — so at intake every skip would warn as missing from a ledger it cannot be in yet. A
check that always warns teaches people to ignore it, and this is the check that would otherwise catch
a genuinely missing ledger entry later.

It must exit 0. A silent skip, an unauthorized floor skip, a TDD omission, or a lightened step with no
`first_pass` flag exits 2 and is non-waivable.

Then fold the skips into the durable roll-up so they survive the next intake replacing this file.
**Every workflow does this** (CR-10 is project-wide, and the onboarding and docs routes never declare
a manifest domain at all):

```bash
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is unset in the Bash tool; a bare "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/..." becomes "/...".
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(python3 -c "import json,os;d=json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json')));[print(i['installPath']) for i in d.get('plugins',{}).get('hitl@hitl',[]) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(i.get('installPath',''),'.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))]" 2>/dev/null | head -1)}"
CHK="ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"; RS="ci/first-pass/resurface.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || CHK="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$RS" ]] || RS="$ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/resurface.py"
python3 "$CHK" .hitl/current-change.yaml
python3 "$RS" --change .hitl/current-change.yaml --rollup .hitl/skip-ledger.yaml --append
```

With no area declared yet, entries record as **project-wide** and resurface at any later change until
resolved. The `development` route re-runs this at its impact step, narrowing them to the real scope.
Both runs are idempotent on `(change_id, step)`. If `ci/first-pass/` is absent, say so plainly and tell the
user to run `/hitl:dev-update` — that state means the skip ledger is uncertified for **every** change on
the project, not just this one.

---

## Step 7 — Commit and push the change file

Anchor the change to this branch so anyone who picks it up resumes from the right context:

```bash
git add .hitl/current-change.yaml
git commit -m "chore(hitl): start <change_id> (<workflow>) — seed change context"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true   # push if a remote exists
```

---

## Step 8 — Route into the workflow

Hand off to the workflow's own skill and follow the breadcrumb from there:

- `development` → **`/hitl:dev-apply-change <N>`** (impact analysis → plan; steps 1–9)
- `brownfield`  → **`/hitl:dev-start-brownfield`**
- `migration`   → **`/hitl:dev-start-migration`**
- `prd`         → **`/hitl:dev-start-from-prd`**

As each step completes, update the matching step's `status` to `done` and the next step's to
`current` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` (set `current_step` to match) so the breadcrumb advances.

## Important Rules

- A change must trace to a GitHub issue — never proceed without one.
- Never hand-write the `workflow.steps` block; always seed it from the bundled `workflows.yaml`
  catalog (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/workflows.yaml`) via the Step 6 generator.
- One active change per branch. Don't clobber an existing active change — switch context instead.
