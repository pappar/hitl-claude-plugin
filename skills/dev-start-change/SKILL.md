description: Start work on a change the right way — pick a GitHub issue, determine the correct HITL workflow (development / brownfield / migration / prd), show its full step plan, seed and push the self-describing .hitl/current-change.yaml, then route into the workflow. This is the front door for every change; the session-start gate insists on it before any work.
argument-hint: "[issue number or description]"
disable-model-invocation: true
---

**Before doing anything else:** Check whether `.hitl/` exists in the current directory. If it does not, stop immediately and output this — do not proceed with any steps:

```
This project hasn't been set up for HITL.
To get started, run one of these commands in your project directory:

  /hitl:dev-start-from-prd      new project from a PRD
  /hitl:dev-start-brownfield    adopt HITL on an existing codebase
  /hitl:dev-start-migration     migrate a system
```

---

# Start a Change

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (optional issue number or short description)

This skill is the **enforced front door**. The HITL hooks (`hitl-gate.sh` on session start,
`welcome.sh` on every prompt) inject a directive that no real work may happen until a change is
active for the current branch, and `check-hitl-context.sh` hard-blocks edits until then. This
skill is how that gate is satisfied: it selects the issue, picks the workflow, and writes the
change file.

---

## Step 1 — Don't clobber an active change

Read `.hitl/current-change.yaml`. If it already describes an **active change for the current
branch** (it has a `workflow` or `current_step` block and `expected_branch` matches the current
`git branch --show-current`, or the branch is `issue/N-*` matching `change_id`), stop and say:

> A change is already active on this branch: **<change_id>** (workflow `<id>`, step `<n>/<total>`).
> Continue it, or run `/hitl:dev-switch-context` to move to a different issue.

Only proceed when there is **no** active, branch-matched change.

---

## Step 2 — Choose the issue (insist)

If `$ARGUMENTS` names an issue number, use it. Otherwise list open issues and ask the user to pick one:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 30
```

- If the user describes work that has **no issue**, do not proceed to planning. Offer to create one:
  `/hitl:pm-add-feature` (feature) or `/hitl:pm-report-bug` (bug). A change must trace to an issue.
- Do not invent an issue number. Require an explicit choice.

Read the chosen issue in full:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,labels
```

---

## Step 3 — Determine the workflow (read the issue, then confirm)

Classify the work into exactly one workflow, **state your reasoning**, and confirm with the user
before writing anything:

| Workflow | Choose when | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `prd`        | Greenfield project being stood up from a PRD; no `docs/system-manifest.yaml` yet | `/hitl:dev-start-from-prd` |
| `brownfield` | Existing codebase not yet onboarded to HITL (no manifest / registries) | `/hitl:dev-start-brownfield` |
| `migration`  | Porting or consolidating a system from a source codebase into this target | `/hitl:dev-start-migration` |
| `development`| **Most issues** — a feature, bug fix, or refactor in an already-documented component | `/hitl:dev-apply-change` |
| `docs`       | The change touches **nothing but documentation** — no source, tests, or IaC | `/hitl:dev-generate-docs` |
| `release`    | Publishing a version to users — the change *is* shipping, not building | **follow the 12-step release table in `dev-practices/workflow-steps.md`**; `/hitl:dev-adversarial-review` at step 5 |

Heuristics from the issue: labels (`bug`/`enhancement` → development; `documentation`/`docs` → docs), wording ("migrate",
"port", "consolidate" → migration; "onboard", "adopt HITL", "no docs yet" → brownfield), and
whether `docs/system-manifest.yaml` exists (absent on a real project → prd/brownfield).

**The `docs` workflow is only for changes that touch nothing but docs.** If a change edits docs *and* code, it is a `development` change (the delivery spine already reconciles docs). This keeps the docs workflow from becoming a way to skip the gates on real code. Its own reviewer gate (`doc_review`) is domain-routed: route the review to the role that owns the touched area (Architect for design docs, PM for product docs, Ops for runbooks). At its final `merge` step, set the top-level `status: merged` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` so the change file does not linger and satisfy the gate for the next change.

State: "This looks like a **<workflow>** change because …. Proceed with the <workflow> workflow?"
Wait for confirmation (or correction) before Step 4.

---

## Step 3b — Confirm the tier (a human's call, always)

Propose a tier from the issue and say why, then **wait for a human to confirm or correct it**. Do not
seed a change without one. Tier decides which steps may be lightened at all, and nothing downstream
re-checks the declaration against what the change actually touches.

Where protection actually changes, from the catalog: **3 → 2** takes `impact`, `packet`,
`arch_review`, `qa_verify` and `rollout` off `floor` in one move; **2 → 1** moves only
`integration_verify`; `deploy` and `promote` never demote.

So **declaring 2 instead of 3 is the consequential call**, and it is the one the tooling does not
guard: tier 2 is the generator's default and needs no attribution. Treat the 3 → 2 decision as the
one to slow down on, whatever the paperwork asks for. Default up.

Tiers are defined in [`/hitl:dev-practices`](../dev-practices/SKILL.md). At **tier 0 or 1** the change
file must record `tier_set_by` and `tier_reason`, and the generator refuses without them. That
attribution exists because tier 0/1 unlocks the batch-decline path in Step 4b, not because of floor
demotion — be honest about which lock is on which door.

> Default up. If a change could plausibly be tier 2 or tier 3, it is tier 3. The cost of extra process
> is lower than the cost of an under-reviewed change, and a wrong tier is not caught later.

---

## Step 4 — Show the step plan

Read the chosen workflow's steps from the bundled workflow catalog — `workflows.yaml`, resolved
as `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/workflows.yaml` in the installed plugin (or `ai/shared/workflows.yaml`
when running from source) — and print the whole journey **by phase**, e.g.:

```
development workflow — 31 steps (+19a) across 7 phases:
  Requirements  2   Issue → Figma
  Design        7   Impact → Packet
  Build         8   RED → Conv
  Verify        6   Rvw1 → QAVfy
  Assess        2   ImpBrf → Rollout
  Ship          5   VfyPR → Promote
  Post-Ship     2   30dROI → 90dROI
```

This still shows the whole journey up front — that principle holds, and the shape of the work is what a
person actually needs to decide whether the workflow fits. A thirty-one item list is the moment a small
change starts to feel like the wrong tool, and position is carried by the breadcrumb from here on anyway.

**Print the full ordered list on request** ("show me every step"), and always print it in full for a
workflow of 10 steps or fewer, where the phase summary would be longer than the list it replaces.

---

## Step 4b — Offer First Pass (optional, FR-29)

**First Pass** is the skip-with-record way to run this same plan: lighten what does not apply, on the
record, and keep going. It is for anyone right-sizing a change — a developer on a one-line regression as
much as a PM shipping a thin first version. It is opt-in; the default is the full plan.

**At tier 0 or 1, offer the ceremony steps pre-selected as declined.** A bug fix does not need a Figma
review, an ROI model, a training plan, or two ROI checkpoints, and making someone decline each one by
hand is the friction that pushes people out of the process entirely. Present them ticked, with a
one-line reason filled in ("tier 1: not required at this tier"), and let one confirmation record the lot.

Pre-selected is not pre-recorded. **Nothing is written until the human confirms**, and doing nothing
still runs the full plan — `keep` remains the default disposition (CR-1). The actor on every resulting
record is the person who confirmed, never the agent.

**Present the disposition menu ONCE** (brief mode — not a step-by-step interview). Each step's `crit`
(from the catalog, resolved against this change's `tier`) constrains its options:

| step type | options offered |
|---|---|
| `ceremony` | keep · starter\* · skip (defer / decline) |
| `standard` | keep · starter\* · defer · decline |
| `standard` + `no_omit` (TDD RED/GREEN) | keep · starter — *never defer/decline* |
| `floor` | keep · *request risk-accepted skip* |

\*starter offered only for steps in the registry (`ci/first-pass/starters.py`); `keep` is the default.

**This step elicits choices; it does not write the ledger.** The change file does not exist yet — Step 6
creates it — so recording here would write to a stale or absent file that Step 6 then overwrites. Capture
the choices and let the generator apply them:

```bash
# Only NON-keep steps go in. An absent step means keep. `actor` is the accountable human, not the agent.
cat > .hitl/first-pass-choices.json <<'JSON'
{
  "actor": "name@team",
  "choices": {
    "roi":   { "disposition": "decline", "reason": "internal tool; ROI self-evident" },
    "figma": { "disposition": "defer",   "reason": "no UI change", "followup_ref": "GH-123" },
    "docs":  { "disposition": "starter", "reason": "thin first pass" }
  }
}
JSON
```

Rules that still apply when collecting the choices:
1. **Floor** — a `floor` skip requires the accountable role's risk-accepted `ack_by` + reason, and (for a
   step mapping to a hard gate) a linked `waiver_ref`. A skip is **not** a waiver. Put both in the entry.
2. **Starter** — write the honest-minimal artifact from `starters.py` (e.g. acceptance criteria = "a working
   version of the system"), mark it `needs-enhancement`, record its path; seed a fast-follow to *enhance* it.
3. **Defer** — seed a linked fast-follow ticket and put its ref in `followup_ref`.

If the validator is missing, say so **before** collecting any choices — the ledger is unenforced without it:

```bash
CHK="ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || CHK="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || echo "⚠ First Pass validator not found — run /hitl:dev-update to install it. Do NOT record skips until it is present: the ledger is unenforced without it."
```

Certification happens in **Step 6b**, once the change file exists and there is something real to certify.

Run the change under **brief mode** ([`shared/first-pass/brief.md`](../../shared/first-pass/brief.md) —
say less, ask less, never re-ask what intake already settled) and the **reduced-friction permission policy**
([`shared/first-pass/permissions.md`](../../shared/first-pass/permissions.md)); use the neutral /
respectful language in [`shared/first-pass/language.md`](../../shared/first-pass/language.md).

> **Resurfacing does not happen here.** `resurface.surface()` matches unresolved skips against the new
> change's domains and `allowed_paths`, and neither is known until the workflow's own impact step fills
> them. Called at change start it always matches nothing. It belongs at the impact step, where scope
> exists. See the worked example at
> [`docs/examples/first-pass/`](https://github.com/Prasad-Apparaju/hitl-dev-platform/tree/main/docs/examples/first-pass).

---

## Step 5 — Create the branch

```bash
N=<issue-number>
TITLE=$(gh issue view "$N" --json title -q .title \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | cut -c1-50 | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//')
# cut BEFORE sed: truncating after the trim re-introduces the trailing hyphen the trim
# just removed, so every title over 50 chars yields `issue/N-…-` (plugin issue #26).
BRANCH="issue/${N}-${TITLE}"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$BRANCH"
```

---

## Step 6 — Seed and write `.hitl/current-change.yaml`

Generate the embedded `workflow` block **from the catalog** (do not hand-write the steps — that
is how drift starts). Run this generator, which copies the chosen workflow's steps, marks the
first step `current` and the rest `open`, and stamps the versions:

```bash
WF=<development|brownfield|migration|migration_review|prd|release|docs>
CHANGE_ID="GH-<N>"
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
# Resolve a working Python (Windows-safe: python3 is the MS Store stub there). See issue #14.
PY=""; for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c "import sys" >/dev/null 2>&1 && { PY="$c"; break; }; done
[[ -n "$PY" ]] || { echo "No usable Python found (need python3, python, or py on PATH)."; exit 1; }
HITL_VERSION=$(cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" 2>/dev/null \
  | "$PY" -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('version','0.0.0'))" 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0")

TIER_REASON=""               # required when TIER <= 1: one line on why it qualifies
CHOICES=".hitl/first-pass-choices.json"   # written by Step 4b; absent ⇒ full plan, no First Pass

---

## Step 6b — Certify the ledger

Only meaningful once the change file exists. Run it **before** the Step 7 commit, so nothing
uncertified is ever pushed:

```bash
CHK="ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
[[ -f "$CHK" ]] || CHK="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/check_skips.py"
python3 "$CHK" .hitl/current-change.yaml
```

**No `--rollup` here, deliberately.** The roll-up is written at the impact step, once the change knows
its own area — so at intake every skip would warn as missing from a ledger it cannot be in yet. A
check that always warns teaches people to ignore it, and this is the check that would otherwise catch
a genuinely missing ledger entry later.

It must exit 0. A silent skip, an unauthorized floor skip, a TDD omission, or a lightened step with no
`first_pass` flag exits 2 and is non-waivable.

Then fold the skips into the durable roll-up so they survive the next intake replacing this file.
**Every workflow does this** (CR-10 is project-wide, and the onboarding and docs routes never declare
a manifest domain at all):

```bash
RS="ci/first-pass/resurface.py"
[[ -f "$RS" ]] || RS="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/ci/first-pass/resurface.py"
python3 "$RS" --change .hitl/current-change.yaml --rollup .hitl/skip-ledger.yaml --append
```

With no area declared yet, entries record as **project-wide** and resurface at any later change until
resolved. The `development` route re-runs this at its impact step, narrowing them to the real scope.
Both runs are idempotent on `(change_id, step)`. If `ci/first-pass/` is absent, say so plainly and tell the
user to run `/hitl:dev-update` — that state means the skip ledger is uncertified for **every** change on
the project, not just this one.

---

## Step 7 — Commit and push the change file

Anchor the change to this branch so anyone who picks it up resumes from the right context:

```bash
git add .hitl/current-change.yaml
git commit -m "chore(hitl): start <change_id> (<workflow>) — seed change context"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true   # push if a remote exists
```

## Step 8 — Route into the workflow

Hand off to the workflow's own skill and follow the breadcrumb from there:

- `development` → **`/hitl:dev-apply-change <N>`** (impact analysis → plan; steps 1–9)
- `brownfield`  → **`/hitl:dev-start-brownfield`**
- `migration`   → **`/hitl:dev-start-migration`**
- `prd`         → **`/hitl:dev-start-from-prd`**

As each step completes, update the matching step's `status` to `done` and the next step's to
`current` in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` (set `current_step` to match) so the breadcrumb advances.

## Important Rules

- A change must trace to a GitHub issue — never proceed without one.
- Never hand-write the `workflow.steps` block; always seed it from the bundled `workflows.yaml`
  catalog (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/workflows.yaml`) via the Step 6 generator.
- One active change per branch. Don't clobber an existing active change — switch context instead.
